# Interactable Files
The following folder consists of five main files: *Analyses.h*, *Calculator.h*, *ImportExport.h*, *Normality.h*, and *Outliers.h*. With implementation files in the respected folder.

## Description
These main five files serve as the intermediary between the raw C code and the Python GUI script. The *Calculator.h* file is responsible for controlling the input and storage of the Calculator portion of the program. The *Outliers.h*, *Normality.h*, and *Analyses.h* files serve as the controlling files for all multivariate analyses in the software. Lastly, *ImportExport.h* deals with importing datasets, csv files, and exporting them as well.
