# Compilation
The following folder consists of two main files: *Parser.h* and *Scanner.h*. With implementation files in the respected folder.

## Description
The Scanner file scans input from left to right, breaking down the input into tokens, allowing them to be easily parsed by the Parser. The Parser file is the *piece de resistance* of the software, as it composes a whopping recursive descent parsing algorithm capable handling almost any input at any given point in time for a multitude of operations.
