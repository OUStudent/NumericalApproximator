# Statistics
The following folder consists of two main files: *Distributions.h* and *MultivariateStatistics.h*. With implementation files in the respected folder.

## Description
The *Distributions.h* file consists of two types of methods, *p** and *q** methods, like *pnorm* and *qnorm*. The *p** methods seek to find the probability given a quantile value; while the *q** methods find the quantile value given a probability value. The *MultivariateStatistics.h* file contains all the multivariate analyses featured in this software, from basic mean/covariance/correlation matrices to Factor Analysis.
