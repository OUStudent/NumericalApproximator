# Numerical Analysis
The following folder consists of two main files: *Integration.h* and *RootSolving.h*. With implementation files in the respected folder.

## Description
The *Integration.h* file comprises of advanced integral estimating techniques, built off an Adaptive Composite Simpson method. The usability of these methods include the calculation of single integrals, and single integrals with infinity bounds. The *RootSolving.h* file contains two traditional, but yet powerful, methods for solving linear root solving problems: the Bisection Method, and Newton Raphson's Method.
